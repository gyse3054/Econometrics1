User-written Functions
One of the great strengths of R is the user's ability to add functions. In fact, many of the functions in R are actually functions of functions. The structure of a function is given below.
```{r}
myfunction <- function(arg1, arg2, ... ){
statements
return(object)
}
```
Objects in the function are local to the function. The object returned can be any data type. Here is an example.
```{r}
# function example - get measures of central tendency
# and spread for a numeric vector x. The user has a
# choice of measures and whether the results are printed.

mysummary <- function(x,npar=TRUE,print=TRUE) {
  if (!npar) {
    center <- mean(x); spread <- sd(x) 
  } else {
    center <- median(x); spread <- mad(x) 
  }
  if (print & !npar) {
    cat("Mean=", center, "\n", "SD=", spread, "\n")
  } else if (print & npar) {
    cat("Median=", center, "\n", "MAD=", spread, "\n")
  }
  result <- list(center=center,spread=spread)
  return(result)
}

# invoking the function 
set.seed(1234)
x <- rpois(500, 4) 
y <- mysummary(x)
Median= 4
MAD= 1.4826 
# y$center is the median (4) 
# y$spread is the median absolute deviation (1.4826)

y <- mysummary(x, npar=FALSE, print=FALSE)
# no output 
# y$center is the mean (4.052)
# y$spread is the standard deviation (2.01927)
```
It can be instructive to look at the code of a function. In R, you can view a function's code by typing the function name without the ( ). If this method fails, look at the following R Wiki link for hints on viewing function sourcecode.
Finally, you may want to store your own functions, and have them available in every session. You can customize the R enviroment to load your functions at start-up.
## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
